## 👋 Hi there

😄   Pronouns: she/her  
❣️   [Behance.net/cmls](https://www.behance.net/cmls)

🎨   I’ve been working as a UI/UX Designer and Product Designer since 2018 in Campinas - SP;  
💻   Currently in the 11th semester of Computer Science at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP);  
🍎   Recently graduated from the Apple Developer Academy at the Eldorado Research Institute;  

I strongly believe in the power of technology and human centered design, together, to improve people's lives. And that’s what I keep in mind as I fall more and more in love with what I do!
My passions in the field are design for accessibility and inclusion, graphic design, frame-by-frame animation and 3D modeling.
Outside of work, I spend my time with crafts (I am an embroiderer, crochet maker and make small sculptures with biscuit), reading thrillers and practicing aerial circus. 🤍
